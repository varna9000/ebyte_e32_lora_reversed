* Ebyte [[https://www.ebyte.com/en/product-view-news.html?id=132][E32-868T20D]] reversed protocol in Micropython

**Most of the heavy lifting was done by the guys from [[https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-LoRa/issues/203][this thread]]


The other test chip is sx1262 on Lilygo's T-deck on 868Mhz. The driving mcu is esp32 with latest micropython installed.

1. You have to install Lora package with 'mip' on the board, once you connect to wifi.

2. Transmit and receive working both ways.

3. e32 is on defaults:
   - channel 0x06
   - address: 0x0000
   - mode: transparent

4. FEC has to *off* on e32.
   You can either use the utility provided by ebyte or set it by putting M0 and M1 pins to low and sending the settings bytes.
   I'll probably try to implement FEC at some stage.
